This is a simple to-do list app that has a list of tasks that the user needs to complete.
If the user types text into a bottom input field and clicks an Add button, the new item will be added to the bottom of the list.
Of course, users are be able to mark items as “done”, and delete them as well!
The app works in normal view and landscape view, as shown below in the screenshots.
